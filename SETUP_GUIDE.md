# Voice Navigation Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start (Browser Speech Recognition)

The voice navigation will work immediately using your browser's built-in speech recognition, no API keys needed!

## üéØ Enhanced Setup (Whisper + ElevenLabs)

For better accuracy and voice responses, follow these steps:

### 1. Create `.env.local` file

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
# OpenAI API Key (for Whisper - FREE for first 3 months)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# ElevenLabs API Key (optional - FREE tier available)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB
```
